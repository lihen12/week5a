      <figcaption>Welcome to my portfolio site! I'm a beginner to HTML5 and CSS3, so the updates to this site will be rolling in as the weeks go by. This will act as my landing page, but I'm not too sure on what to put here, so I went ahead and put my most visited sites. Hope you enjoy!</figcaption>

        <a href="https://reddit.com">The Front Page of Reddit</a>
      </h3>
      
      <p>As a 5 year Reddit user, it's amazing to me how much this site has grown. It is one of the leading website forums for people around the world, especially for those in the tech industry. People of all backgrounds, jobs, ages come together in a forum-like function to discuss on all kinds of topics. The front page of Reddit is how I keep up to date on every single event that's going on in the world. On top of that, I'm learning new things on a daily basis out of pure curiosity.</p>

        <i class="fa fa-reddit" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <a href="https://reddit.com/r/chicagobulls">Chicago Bulls Subreddit</a>
      </h3>
      
      <p>I love the Chicago Bulls. I was born in the city of Chicago where my parents, uncles, grandparents, etc. would always cheer on the Bulls during the '90s. Even after moving to Seattle, I still cheer on the Bulls to this day. Reddit is an innovative community forum where people from all backgrounds around the world meet up to discuss their favorite topics. This subreddit is my first introduction to reddit.</p>

        <a href="https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends">League of Legends Subreddit</a>
      </h3>
      
      <p>You're starting to see the trend here. I love reddit for the reasons listed above. I also like video games and League of Legends is one my favorites. I always have this browser open when I'm on my computer.</p>

      <h3>
        <i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a>
      </h3>
      
      <p>I feel like in this day and age, Twitter is an essential app/website that needs to be used by people of all backgrounds especially in the tech industry. Whether you need to look at live updates, industry news, social news, etc., Twitter fills all those niches. Even if you don't like posting on your own account, it's important to stay informed if you don't use a site like Reddit.</p>
